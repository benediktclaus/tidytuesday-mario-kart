# Mario Kart 64 World Records

The data this week comes from [Mario Kart World Records](https://mkwrs.com/) and contains world records for the classic (if you're a 90's kid) racing game on the Nintendo 64. 

This [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6cpa-TvKn8&ab_channel=SummoningSalt) talks about the history of Mario Kart 64 World Records in greater detail. Despite it's release back in 1996 (1997 in Europe and North America), it is still actiely played by many and new world records are achieved every month.

The game consists of 16 individual tracks and world records can be achieved for the fastes **single lap** or the fastest completed race (**three laps**). Also, through the years, players discovered **shortcuts** in many of the tracks. Fortunately, shortcut and non-shortcut world records are listed separately.

Furthermore, the Nintendo 64 was released for NTSC- and PAL-systems. On PAL-systems, the game runs a little slower. All times in this dataset are PAL-times, but they can be converted back to NTSC-times.
